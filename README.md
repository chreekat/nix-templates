A collection of Nix templates I use.

It's still a "collection" if there's only one entry, right?

## Templates in this repo

*Use these templates with `nix flake init -t github:chreekat/nix-templates#<name-of-template>`*

**1. haskell-generic**

Everything one needs to build a Cabal project in the simple case.

(Feel free to suggest more.)
